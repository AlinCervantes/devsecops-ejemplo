      # Step 4: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) with Bandit
      - name: SAST with Bandit
        run: bandit -r . || true
        # `|| true` allows the pipeline to continue even if Bandit finds issues.
        # In a real environment, you might omit this to fail the pipeline on vulnerabilities.

      # Step 5: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) with Snyk
      - name: Dependency Scan with Snyk

        # `continue-on-error: true` allows the pipeline to continue if Snyk encounters an error.
        # In production, you would typically require this step to pass.

      # Step 6: Build the Docker image
      - name: Build Docker image
        run: docker build -t my-app:latest .

      # Step 7: Scan the Docker image for vulnerabilities with Trivy

          severity: 'CRITICAL'
          exit-code: '1'
        # `exit-code: '1'` will cause this step to fail and stop the pipeline if critical vulnerabilities are found.
